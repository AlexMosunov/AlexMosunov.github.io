# My portfolio of web-projects - AlexMosunov.github.io

### Hello, here you can find my portfolio of web projects which consists of 4 websites (startup landing page is to be uploaded soon).

## [Food delivery (Omnifood) company's web-site](https://alexmosunov.github.io) - AlexMosunov.github.io - on the fisrt page you can find links to 3 other websites. Just click them!
This web-site is written using HTML, CSS and jQuery. There is a possibilty to add php for the contact form. Web-site is fully responsive, jQuey is added for special effects. This is my first website that I created while completing course on web design & development. 

## [Website for my own business (distribution of women clothes and underwear)](https://alexmosunov.github.io/lingerie-bra) - AlexMosunov.github.io/lingerie-bra
I have ccreated this website to digitalize my business. I always wanted to have a beautiful internet catalog of the good that I am selling. When you hover on the image - it changes, buttons are responsive. There is a commented out php add on in the index.html file. I used php to collect orders from my customers.

## [Personal photogallery](https://alexmosunov.github.io/photogallery) - AlexMosunov.github.io/photogallery
Photography is my hobbie, so I created this web-site to highlight my works. I added some jQuery to add effects when you hover on the name of the particular gallery (for example "Boston").
